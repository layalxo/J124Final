# J124 Final Project: Data Analysis & Visualization of Where it Pays to Attend College
## By Layal Younan
1. I downloaded the “Where it Pays to Attend College” data sheets as .csv files.
2. I uploaded those files into my Google Drive.
3. I opened them on my Google Drive with Google Sheets. 
4. There were three separate data sets provided by The Wall Street Journal. I copy and pasted two of the data sets into the third one as separate sheets, that way I could view all three of the data sets in one Google Sheet file, as three separate sheets. 
5. I looked through the sheets to find anything that stood out to me.
6. The following are five questions and step-by-step answers I came up with based on the data sets:

**Question 1: _Which undergraduate major has the highest percent change of starting to mid-career (median) salary, and which has the lowest?_** <br>

**Step-by-step answer:**
1. Bold all of the boxes in the first row in order to recognize them as headers.
2. Freeze the first row in order to understand what the boxes represent when scrolling through the data set.
